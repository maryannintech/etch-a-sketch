# Project: Etch-A-Sketch
This project is part of the curriculum of The Odin Project, a recreation of the toy Etch a Sketch. This project made me understand more about DOM manipulation and different Javascript functions. I tried to lessen the global variables and added more comments because I want to practice good coding habits. I enjoy learning and playing with this project ðŸ’—
